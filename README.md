# Slides on SimulationIO and yt

Author: Jonah Miller <jonah.maxwell.miller@gmail.com>

My slides on SimulationIO and the yt-project for the 2016 Einstein
Toolkit workshop. In the notebooks directory, the tutorial notebooks
are available. Unfortunately, the data they analize is not, as it's
far too large to put in a git repository.
