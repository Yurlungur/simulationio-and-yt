# Slides on SimulationIO and yt

Author: Jonah Miller <jonah.maxwell.miller@gmail.com>

My slides on SimulationIO and the yt-project for the 2016 Einstein
Toolkit workshop. In the notebooks directory, the tutorial notebooks
are available. I also include the static TOV data. Unfortunately, the
other data they analize is not as it is too large.

# Instructions for notebooks

* Install SimulationIO and yt-simulationio locally (see below)

* Install [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)

* Clone this repository and navigate to the notebooks directory

* Run `jupyter notebook`

* The first three notebooks will work. The last two will not but they
  may be of use to you.
